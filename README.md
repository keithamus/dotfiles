These dotfiles are setup to work with https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap which is an awesome tool for setting up a new machine how tou want it.

These dotfiles themselves are just a collection of install scripts which sometimes copy things into your folders, sometimes install stuff, and sometimes just set magical preferences. The dotfiles part is a lie. Shh, don't tell anyone, they won't read this far.

## Notes

 - You can re-run `./install.sh` as many times as you want. It will not do weird stuff (hopefully)
 - You can (re)install individual plugins by running the `install.sh` in their folder - e.g. `sh ~/.dotfiles/rust/install.sh`
