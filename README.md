# Dotfiles

> These are my dotfiles. There are many like it but these are mine.

## Setting up

1. Make sure you have git, alternatively you can download a zip file of the repo [here][zip]
2. Run `./install.sh`. It will quiz you and take you through the setup.

## Notes

 - You can re-run `./install.sh` as many times as you want. It will not do weird stuff (hopefully)
 - You can (re)install individual plugins by running the `install.sh` in their folder - e.g. `sh ~/.dotfiles/rust/install.sh`
